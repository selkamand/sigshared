**sigshared** contains general utilities used in many other R packages
in the [sigverse](https://github.com/selkamand/sigverse)

Unless you’re developing / maintaining a sigverse package, there is
probably very little reason to ever download this package explicitly. We
reccomend just installing the full sigverse as described
[here](https://github.com/selkamand/sigverse)

## Installation

You can install the development version of sigshared from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("selkamand/sigshared")
```

## Toolkits

### Assertions for key data structures

``` r
assert_signature()
assert_signature_collection()
assert_decomposition()
assert_decomposition_collection()
assert_cohort_analysis()
```
