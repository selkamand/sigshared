\alias{with_temp_seed}
\title{Run code with a specific random seed without disturbing the global environment}
\usage{
with_temp_seed(seed, expr)
}
\arguments{
\item{seed}{\link{numeric} The random seed to temporarily set during the evaluation of \code{expr}.}

\item{expr}{\link{expression} The expression to be evaluated with the temporary random seed.}
}
\value{
The result of evaluating the expression \code{expr}.
}
\description{
Temporarily sets a specific random seed to ensure reproducibility for the
provided expression. Once the expression is evaluated, the previous random
seed (if it existed) is restored, ensuring that the global random seed
state remains unchanged.
}
\examples{
# Run a block of code with a specific random seed
with_temp_seed(123, {
  runif(1)
})

# The global random seed remains unchanged after running the expression
runif(1)
}
